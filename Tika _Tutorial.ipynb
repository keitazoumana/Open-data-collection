      "\n",
      "COVID-19 Vaccination, Testing and Face Covering Policy Template\n",
      "\n",
      "The OSHA COVID-19 Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) on Vaccination and Testing generally requires covered employers to establish, implement, and enforce a written mandatory vaccination policy (29 CFR 1910.501(d)(1)).  However, there is an exemption from that requirement for employers that establish, implement, and enforce a written policy allowing any employee not subject to a mandatory vaccination policy to either choose to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or provide proof of regular testing for COVID-19 and wear a face covering in lieu of vaccination (29 CFR 1910.501(d)(2)). Employers may use this template to develop a policy that provides employees the choice of COVID-19 vaccination or regular COVID-19 testing and face covering use. \n",
      "Employers using this template will need to customize areas marked with blue text and modify (change, add, or remove sections of) this document to accurately represent their policies. Text that is italicized is sample language employers may use when developing their policies; however, that text is not comprehensive and not all of that text will be applicable to all workplaces. Employers will need to add to or revise the italicized text to ensure the final policy matches the specific procedures that will be implemented in their workplaces. \n",
      "Lastly, employers using this template should consider incorporating their policies and procedures for non-employees (e.g., visitors, customers) and for employees of other employers (e.g., contractor employees).\n",
      "[Employer name]’s Vaccination, Testing, and Face Covering Policy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Purpose:\n",
      "Vaccination is a vital tool to reduce the presence and severity of COVID-19 cases in the workplace, in communities, and in the nation as a whole. [Employer Name] encourages all employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves and other employees. [Consider inserting additional statements about the impact of vaccination of employees on the safety of workers’ families, customers and visitors, business partners, and the community.] However, should an employee choose not to be vaccinated, this policy’s sections on testing and face coverings will apply. This policy complies with OSHA’s Emergency Temporary Standard on Vaccination and Testing (29 CFR 1910.501).\n",
      "\n",
      "Scope:\n",
      "This COVID-19 Policy on vaccination, testing, and face covering use applies to all employees of [Employer Name], except for employees who do not report to a workplace where other individuals (such as coworkers or customers) are present; employees while working from home; and employees who work exclusively outdoors. [Identify specific groups of employees or job categories, if any, that are not covered by this policy because they fall under these exceptions.] \n",
      "\n",
      "All employees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated. Employees are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after completing primary vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine with, if applicable, at least the minimum recommended interval between doses. For example, this includes two weeks after a second dose in a two-dose series, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, two weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, or two weeks after the second dose of any combination of two doses of different COVID-19 vaccines as part of one primary vaccination series. Employees who are not fully vaccinated will be required to provide proof of weekly COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering at the workplace. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some employees may be required to have or obtain a COVID-19 vaccination as a term and condition of employment at [Employer Name], due to their specific job duties (e.g., public facing positions). Employees subject to mandatory vaccination requirements should follow all relevant vaccination procedures in this policy and are not given the choice to choose testing and face covering use in lieu of vaccination. [Identify specific groups of employees or job categories, if any, that are subject to a mandatory vaccination requirement.]\n",
      "\n",
      "All employees are required to report their vaccination status and, if vaccinated, provide proof of vaccination. Employees must provide truthful and accurate information about their COVID-19 vaccination status, and, if not fully vaccinated, their testing results. Employees not in compliance with this policy will be subject to discipline. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Insert additional information on potential discipline for workers who do not follow the policy (e.g., unpaid leave, termination)] \n",
      "\n",
      "Employees may request an exception from vaccination requirements (if applicable) if the vaccine is medically contraindicated for them or medical necessity requires a delay in vaccination. Employees also may be legally entitled to a reasonable accommodation if they cannot be vaccinated and/or wear a face covering (as otherwise required by this policy) because of a disability, or if the provisions in this policy for vaccination, and/or testing for COVID-19, and/or wearing a face covering conflict with a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance. Requests for exceptions and reasonable accommodations must be initiated by [insert relevant instructions].  All such requests will be handled in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and [insert reference(s) to the employer’s applicable policies and procedures].  \n",

      "Vaccination\n",
      "Any [Employer Name] employee that chooses to or is required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 must be fully vaccinated no later than [Date]. Any employee not fully vaccinated by [Date] will be subject to the regular testing and face covering requirements of the policy. \n",
      "To be fully vaccinated by [Date], an employee must:\n",
      "· Obtain the first dose of a two dose vaccine no later than [Date]; and the second dose no later than [Date]; or\n",
      "· Obtain one dose of a single dose vaccine no later than [Date].\n",
      "Employees will be considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the requisite number of doses of a COVID-19 vaccine as stated above. An employee will be considered partially vaccinated if they have received only one dose of a two dose vaccine.  \n",
      "[Describe how employees may schedule their vaccination appointments, e.g., through an on-site clinic, through their own medical provider, or with a mass-vaccination clinic.  Also, mention who will be maintaining this policy, e.g., human resources or a designated coordinator, and provide any other general information employees need that is not addressed in the sections below.]\n",
      "Testing and Face Coverings\n",
      "All employees who are not fully vaccinated as of [Date] will be required to undergo regular COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering when in the workplace. Policies and procedures for testing and face coverings are described in the relevant sections of this policy. \n",
      "Vaccination Status and Acceptable Forms of Proof of Vaccination\n",
      "[This section should provide information on how the employer will comply with 29 CFR 1910.501(e) to determine each employee’s vaccination status and require vaccinated employees to provide acceptable proof of vaccination.]\n",
      "Vaccinated Employees\n",
      "All vaccinated employees are required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of where they received vaccination. Proof of vaccination status can be submitted via [insert how employees can submit vaccination information, e.g., the employer’s vaccination portal or in-person at the HR office].\n",
      "Acceptable proof of vaccination status is:   \n",
      "1. The record of immunization from a health care provider or pharmacy; \n",
      "2. A copy of the COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card; \n",
      "3. A copy of medical records documenting the vaccination;\n",
      "4. A copy of immunization records from a public health, state, or tribal immunization information system; or \n",
      "5. A copy of any other official documentation that contains the type of vaccine administered, date(s) of administration, and the name of the health care professional(s) or clinic site(s) administering the vaccine(s). \n",
      "Proof of vaccination generally should include the employee’s name, the type of vaccine administered, the date(s) of administration, and the name of the health care professional(s) or clinic site(s) that administered the vaccine. In some cases, state immunization records may not include one or more of these data fields, such as clinic site; in those circumstances [Employer name] will still accept the state immunization record as acceptable proof of vaccination.\n",
      "If an employee is unable to produce one of these acceptable forms of proof of vaccination, despite attempts to do so (e.g., by trying to contact the vaccine administrator or state health department), the employee can provide a signed and dated statement attesting to their vaccination status (fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated); attesting that they have lost and are otherwise unable to produce one of the other forms of acceptable proof; and including the following language: \n",
      "“I declare (or certify, verify, or state) that this statement about my vaccination status is true and accurate.  I understand that knowingly providing false information regarding my vaccination status on this form may subject me to criminal penalties.”  \n",
      "An employee who attests to their vaccination status in this way should to the best of their recollection, include in their attestation the type of vaccine administered, the date(s) of administration, and the name of the health care professional(s) or clinic site(s) administering the vaccine.   \n",
      "[Describe documentation procedures for employees who are fully vaccinated, employees who are partially vaccinated, and employees who have not yet been vaccinated.]\n",

      "Supporting COVID-19 Vaccination\n",
      "[This section should provide information on how the employer will comply with 29 CFR 1910.501(f) and provide support for employee vaccination, including by providing up to four hours paid time at the regular rate of pay for each of their vaccination dose(s) and reasonable time and paid sick leave for recovery from side effects experienced following any vaccination dose.]\n",
      "An employee may take up to four hours of duty time per dose to travel to the vaccination site, receive a vaccination, and return to work.  This would mean a maximum of eight hours of duty time for employees receiving two doses.  If an employee spends less time getting the vaccine, only the necessary amount of duty time will be granted.  Employees who take longer than four hours to get the vaccine must send [their supervisor] an email documenting the reason for the additional time (e.g., they may need to travel long distances to get the vaccine). Any additional time requested will be granted, if reasonable, but will not be paid; in that situation, the employee can elect to use accrued leave, e.g., sick leave, to cover the additional time. If an employee is vaccinated outside of their approved duty time they will not be compensated.\n",
      "Employees may utilize up to two workdays of sick leave immediately following each dose if they have side effects from the COVID-19 vaccination that prevent them from working. Employees who have no sick leave will be granted up to two days of additional sick leave immediately following each dose if necessary. \n",
      "The following procedures apply for requesting and granting duty time to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine or sick leave to recover from side effects:\n",
      "[Describe how an employee should obtain necessary approvals, how to submit requests, how leave is being granted, etc.]\n",

      "Employee Notification of COVID-19 and Removal from the Workplace\n",
      "[This section should provide information on how the employer will comply with 29 CFR 1910.501(h), which provides that employers must (1) require employees to promptly notify the employer when they receive a positive COVID-19 test or are diagnosed with COVID-19; (2) immediately remove such employees from the workplace; and (3) keep those employees removed until they meet return to work criteria.] \n",
      "[Employer Name] will require employees to promptly notify [their supervisor] when they have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider.\n",
      "[Describe how employees will communicate with the employer if they are sick or experiencing symptoms while at home or at work.]\n",
      "[Describe any leave policies (e.g., sick leave, Family Medical Leave Act, other policies) that the employer will implement for employees who test positive for or are diagnosed with COVID-19.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Medical Removal from the Workplace\n",
      "[Employer name] has also implemented a policy for keeping COVID-19 positive employees from the workplace in certain circumstances. [Employer name] will immediately remove an employee from the workplace if they have received a positive COVID-19 test or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider (i.e., immediately send them home or to seek medical care, as appropriate).\n",
      "[Describe the employer’s policies for removing employees from the workplace and any relevant procedures for working remotely or in isolation.]\n",
      "Return to Work Criteria\n",
      "For any employee removed because they are COVID-19 positive, [Employer name] will keep them removed from the workplace until the employee receives a negative result on a COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) following a positive result on a COVID-19 antigen test if the employee chooses to seek a NAAT test for confirmatory testing; meets the return to work criteria in CDC’s “Isolation Guidance”; or receives a recommendation to return to work from a licensed healthcare provider. \n",
      "Under CDC’s “Isolation Guidance,” asymptomatic employees may return to work once 10 days have passed since the positive test, and symptomatic employees may return to work after all the following are true:\n",
      "· At least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared, and\n",
      "· At least 24 hours have passed with no fever without fever-reducing medication, and\n",
      "· Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving (loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months and need not delay the end of isolation).\n",
      "\n",
      "If an employee has severe COVID-19 or an immune disease, [Employer name] will follow the guidance of a licensed healthcare provider regarding return to work.\n",
      "[Describe the employer’s policies for employees returning to work following removal from the workplace.]\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID-19 Testing\n",
      "[This section should provide information on how the employer will comply with 29 CFR 1910.501(g) and address COVID-19 testing for employees in the workplace who are not fully vaccinated.]\n",
      "All employees who are not fully vaccinated will be required to comply with this policy for testing. \n",
      "Employees who report to the workplace at least once every seven days: \n",
      "(A) must be tested for COVID-19 at least once every seven days; and\n",
      "(B) must provide documentation of the most recent COVID-19 test result to [the supervisor] no later than the seventh day following the date on which the employee last provided a test result.\n",
      "Any employee who does not report to the workplace during a period of seven or more days (e.g., if they were teleworking for two weeks prior to reporting to the workplace): \n",
      "(A) must be tested for COVID-19 within seven days prior to returning to the workplace; and\n",
      "(B) must provide documentation of that test result to [the supervisor] upon return to the workplace.\n",
      "If an employee does not provide documentation of a COVID-19 test result as required by this policy, they will be removed from the workplace until they provide a test result.    \n",
      "Employees who have received a positive COVID-19 test, or have been diagnosed with COVID-19 by a licensed healthcare provider, are not required to undergo COVID-19 testing for 90 days following the date of their positive test or diagnosis.\n",
      "[Describe how employees can fulfill the weekly testing requirement, including where they can get tested, the required schedule for testing (this should address any differences between employees who regularly come to the workplace versus those who do not), and who will cover the costs.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Face Coverings\n",
      "[This section should provide information on how the employer will comply with 29 CFR 1910.501(i), which generally requires employers to ensure that each employee who is not fully vaccinated wears a face covering when indoors and when occupying a vehicle with another person for work purposes.]\n",
      "[Employer name] will require all employees who are not fully vaccinated to wear a face covering. Face coverings must: (i) completely cover the nose and mouth; (ii) be made with two or more layers of a breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass through when held up to a light source); (iii) be secured to the head with ties, ear loops, or elastic bands that go behind the head. If gaiters are worn, they should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers; (iv) fit snugly over the nose, mouth, and chin with no large gaps on the outside of the face; and (v) be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, visible holes, punctures, or other openings. Acceptable face coverings include clear face coverings or cloth face coverings with a clear plastic panel that, despite the non-cloth material allowing light to pass through, otherwise meet these criteria and which may be used to facilitate communication with people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing or others who need to see a speaker’s mouth or facial expressions to understand speech or sign language respectively.  \n",
      "Employees who are not fully vaccinated must wear face coverings over the nose and mouth when indoors and when occupying a vehicle with another person for work purposes. Policies and procedures for face coverings will be implemented, along with the other provisions required by OSHA’s COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing ETS, as part of a multi-layered infection control approach for unvaccinated workers.  \n",
      "[Describe how employees will obtain face coverings (e.g., purchased by employer or self-provided) and instructions about when and how they should be worn or used.]\n",
      "The following are exceptions to [Employer name]’s requirements for face coverings: \n",
      "1. When an employee is alone in a room with floor to ceiling walls and a closed door.\n",
      "2. For a limited time, while an employee is eating or drinking at the workplace or for identification purposes in compliance with safety and security requirements.\n",
      "3. When an employee is wearing a respirator or facemask.\n",
      "4. Where [Employer name] has determined that the use of face coverings is infeasible or creates a greater hazard (e.g., when it is important to see the employee’s mouth for reasons related to their job duties, when the work requires the use of the employee’s uncovered mouth, or when the use of a face covering presents a risk of serious injury or death to the employee).  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "New Hires:\n",
      "All new employees are required to comply with the vaccination, testing, and face covering requirements outlined in this policy as soon as practicable and as a condition of employment. Potential candidates for employment will be notified of the requirements of this policy prior to the start of employment. \n",
      "[Describe how new employees must comply with this policy, including any deadlines for submitting vaccination documentation or COVID-19 test results.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Confidentiality and Privacy:\n",
      "All medical information collected from individuals, including vaccination information, test results, and any other information obtained as a result of testing, will be treated in accordance with applicable laws and policies on confidentiality and privacy.\n",

      "Ivory Coast, also known as Côte d'Ivoire,[a] officially the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, is a country located on the south coast of West Africa. Côte d'Ivoire's political capital is Yamoussoukro in the centre of the country, while its largest city and \"economic capital\" is the port city of Abidjan. It borders Guinea to the northwest, Liberia to the west, Mali to the northwest, Burkina Faso to the northeast, Ghana to the east, and the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) to the south. The official language of the republic is French, with local indigenous languages also being widely used that include Bété, Baoulé, Dioula, Dan, Anyin, and Cebaara Senufo. In total, there are around 78 different languages spoken in Ivory Coast. The country has large populations of the adherents of Christianity, Islam and various indigenous religions.\n",

      "Before its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including Gyaaman, the Kong Empire and Baoulé. The area became a protectorate of France in 1843 and was consolidated as a French colony in 1893 amid the European scramble for Africa. It achieved independence in 1960, led by Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who ruled the country until 1993. Relatively stable by regional standards, Ivory Coast established close political and economic ties with its West African neighbours while at the same time maintaining close relations to the West, especially France. Its stability was diminished by a coup d'état in 1999 and two civil wars, first between 2002 and 2007[8] and again during 2010–2011. In 2000, the country adopted a new constitution.[8]\n",

      "Ivory Coast is a republic with strong executive power vested in its president. Through the production of coffee and cocoa, the country was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s, though it went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period of political and social turmoil. It was not until around 2014 that the gross domestic product again reached the level of its peak in the 1970s.[9] In 2020, Ivory Coast was the world's largest exporter of cocoa beans and had high levels of income for its region.[10] In the 21st century, the Ivorian economy has been largely market-based, and it still relies heavily on agriculture, with smallholder cash-crop production being predominant.[2]\n",

      "\n",
      "Originally, Portuguese and French merchant-explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries divided the west coast of Africa, very roughly, into four \"coasts\" reflecting resources available from each coast. The coast that the French named the Côte d'Ivoire and the Portuguese named the Costa Do Marfim — both, literally, mean \"Coast of Ivory\" — lay between what was known as the Guiné de Cabo Verde, so-called \"Upper Guinea\" at Cap-Vert, and Lower Guinea.[11][12] There was also a Pepper Coast, also known as the \"Grain Coast\" (present-day Liberia), a \"Gold Coast\" (Ghana), and a \"Slave Coast\" (Togo, Benin and Nigeria). Like those, the name \"Ivory Coast\" reflected the major trade that occurred on that particular stretch of the coast: the export of ivory.[13][11][14][12][15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other names included the Côte de Dents,[b] literally \"Coast of Teeth\", again reflecting the trade in ivory;[17][18][13][12][15][19] the Côte de Quaqua, after the people whom the Dutch named the Quaqua (alternatively Kwa Kwa);[18][11][16] the Coast of the Five and Six Stripes, after a type of cotton fabric also traded there;[18] and the Côte du Vent,[c] the Windward Coast, after perennial local off-shore weather conditions.[13][11] One can find the name Cote de(s) Dents regularly used in older works.[18] It was used in Duckett's Dictionnaire (Duckett 1853) and by Nicolas Villault de Bellefond, for example, although Abbé Prévost used Côte d'Ivoire.[19] In the 19th century, usage switched to Côte d'Ivoire.[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "The coastline of the modern state is not quite coterminous with what the 15th- and 16th-century merchants knew as the \"Teeth\" or \"Ivory\" coast, which was considered to stretch from Cape Palmas to Cape Three Points and which is thus now divided between the modern states of Ghana and Ivory Coast (with a minute portion of Liberia).[17][14][19][16] It retained the name through French rule and independence in 1960.[20] The name had long since been translated literally into other languages,[d] which the post-independence government considered increasingly troublesome whenever its international dealings extended beyond the Francophone sphere. Therefore, in April 1986, the government declared that Côte d'Ivoire (or, more fully, République de Côte d'Ivoire[22]) would be its formal name for the purposes of diplomatic protocol, and since then officially refuses to recognize or accept any translation from French to another language in its international dealings.[21][23][24]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the Ivorian government's request, the English translation \"Ivory Coast\" (often \"the Ivory Coast\") is still frequently used in English by various media outlets and publications, including this one, instead of the Côte d'Ivoire.[e][f]\n",

      "The first human presence in Ivory Coast has been difficult to determine because human remains have not been well preserved in the country's humid climate. However, newly found weapon and tool fragments (specifically, polished axes cut through shale and remnants of cooking and fishing) have been interpreted as a possible indication of a large human presence during the Upper Paleolithic period (15,000 to 10,000 BC),[33] or at the minimum, the Neolithic period.[34]\n",

      "The earliest known inhabitants of Ivory Coast have left traces scattered throughout the territory. Historians believe that they were all either displaced or absorbed by the ancestors of the present indigenous inhabitants,[35] who migrated south into the area before the 16th century. Such groups included the Ehotilé (Aboisso), Kotrowou (Fresco), Zéhiri (Grand Lahou), Ega and Diès (Divo).[36]\n",

      "Pre-Islamic and Islamic periods[edit]\n",
      "\n",
      "The first recorded history appears in the chronicles of North African (Berber) traders, who, from early Roman times, conducted a caravan trade across the Sahara in salt, slaves, gold, and other goods.[35] The southern terminals of the trans-Saharan trade routes were located on the edge of the desert, and from there supplemental trade extended as far south as the edge of the rain forest.[35] The most important terminals—Djenné, Gao, and Timbuctu—grew into major commercial centres around which the great Sudanic empires developed.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "By controlling the trade routes with their powerful military forces, these empires were able to dominate neighbouring states.[35] The Sudanic empires also became centres of Islamic education.[35] Islam had been introduced in the western Sudan by Muslim Berber traders from North Africa; it spread rapidly after the conversion of many important rulers.[35] From the 11th century, by which time the rulers of the Sudanic empires had embraced Islam, it spread south into the northern areas of contemporary Ivory Coast.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ghana Empire, the earliest of the Sudanic empires, flourished in the region encompassing present-day southeast Mauritania and southern Mali between the 4th and 13th centuries.[35] At the peak of its power in the 11th century, its realms extended from the Atlantic Ocean to Timbuktu.[35] After the decline of Ghana, the Mali Empire grew into a powerful Muslim state, which reached its apogee in the early part of the 14th century.[35] The territory of the Mali Empire in Ivory Coast was limited to the north-west corner around Odienné.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "Its slow decline starting at the end of the 14th century followed internal discord and revolts by vassal states, one of which, Songhai, flourished as an empire between the 14th and 16th centuries.[35] Songhai was also weakened by internal discord, which led to factional warfare.[35] This discord spurred most of the migrations southward toward the forest belt.[35] The dense rain forest covering the southern half of the country, created barriers to the large-scale political organizations that had arisen in the north.[35] Inhabitants lived in villages or clusters of villages; their contacts with the outside world were filtered through long-distance traders.[37] Villagers subsisted on agriculture and hunting.[37]\n",

      "The Abron kingdom of Gyaaman was established in the 17th century by an Akan group, the Abron, who had fled the developing Ashanti confederation of Asanteman in what is present-day Ghana.[38] From their settlement south of Bondoukou, the Abron gradually extended their hegemony over the Dyula people in Bondoukou, who were recent arrivals from the market city of Begho.[38] Bondoukou developed into a major centre of commerce and Islam.[38] The kingdom's Quranic scholars attracted students from all parts of West Africa.[38] In the mid-17th century in east-central Ivory Coast, other Akan groups fleeing the Asante established a Baoulé kingdom at Sakasso and two Agni kingdoms, Indénié and Sanwi.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Baoulé, like the Ashanti, developed a highly centralized political and administrative structure under three successive rulers.[38] It finally split into smaller chiefdoms.[38] Despite the breakup of their kingdom, the Baoulé strongly resisted French subjugation.[38] The descendants of the rulers of the Agni kingdoms tried to retain their separate identity long after Ivory Coast's independence; as late as 1969, the Sanwi attempted to break away from Ivory Coast and form an independent kingdom.[38]\n",

      "Compared to neighbouring Ghana, Ivory Coast, though practising slavery and slave raiding, suffered little from the slave trade.[39] European slave and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast.[39] The earliest recorded European voyage to West Africa was made by the Portuguese in 1482.[citation needed] The first West African French settlement, Saint Louis, was founded in the mid-17th century in Senegal, while at about the same time, the Dutch ceded to the French a settlement at Gorée Island, off Dakar.[40] A French mission was established in 1687 at Assinie near the border with the Gold Coast (now Ghana).[40] The Europeans suppressed the local practice of slavery at this time and forbade the trade to their merchants.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "Assinie's survival was precarious, however; the French were not firmly established in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century.[40] In 1843–4, French admiral Louis Edouard Bouët-Willaumez signed treaties with the kings of the Grand Bassam and Assinie regions, making their territories a French protectorate.[41] French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region.[40][41] Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "Activity along the coast stimulated European interest in the interior, especially along the two great rivers, the Senegal and the Niger.[40] Concerted French exploration of West Africa began in the mid-19th century, but moved slowly, based more on individual initiative than on government policy.[40] In the 1840s, the French concluded a series of treaties with local West African chiefs that enabled the French to build fortified posts along the Gulf of Guinea to serve as permanent trading centres.[40]\n",

      "The first posts in Ivory Coast included one at Assinie and another at Grand Bassam, which became the colony's first capital.[40] The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts, and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or coutumes paid annually to the local chiefs for the use of the land.[40] The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose.[40] Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "France also wanted to maintain a presence in the region to stem the increasing influence of the British along the Gulf of Guinea coast.[40] The French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic pacification of the interior to stop raids on their settlements.[citation needed] They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against Mandinka tribesmen, mostly from the Gambia.[citation needed] However, raids by the Baoulé and other eastern tribes continued until 1917.[citation needed]\n",
      "\n",
      "The defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the subsequent annexation by Germany of the French province of Alsace-Lorraine caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its West African trading posts, leaving them in the care of resident merchants.[40] The trading post at Grand Bassam in Ivory Coast was left in the care of a shipper from Marseille, Arthur Verdier, who in 1878 was named Resident of the Establishment of Ivory Coast.[40]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1886, to support its claims of effective occupation, France again assumed direct control of its West African coastal trading posts and embarked on an accelerated program of exploration in the interior.[42] In 1887, Lieutenant Louis Gustave Binger began a two-year journey that traversed parts of Ivory Coast's interior. By the end of the journey, he had concluded four treaties establishing French protectorates in Ivory Coast.[43] Also in 1887, Verdier's agent, Marcel Treich-Laplène, negotiated five additional agreements that extended French influence from the headwaters of the Niger River Basin through Ivory Coast.[43]\n",

      "France's main goal was to stimulate the production of exports. Coffee, cocoa, and palm oil crops were soon planted along the coast. Ivory Coast stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of European settlers; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, Europeans who emigrated to the colonies were largely bureaucrats. As a result, French citizens owned one-third of the cocoa, coffee, and banana plantations and adopted the local forced-labour system.[citation needed]\n",

      "Throughout the early years of French rule, French military contingents were sent inland to establish new posts.[43] The African population resisted French penetration and settlement, even in areas where treaties of protection had been in force.[43] Among those offering greatest resistance was Samori Ture, who in the 1880s and 1890s was establishing the Wassoulou Empire, which extended over large parts of present-day Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast.[43] Samori Ture's large, well-equipped army, which could manufacture and repair its own firearms, attracted strong support throughout the region.[43] The French responded to Samori Ture's expansion and conquest with military pressure.[43] French campaigns against Samori Ture, which were met with fierce resistance, intensified in the mid-1890s until he was captured in 1898 and his empire dissolved.[43]\n",

      "Until 1958, governors appointed in Paris administered the colony of Ivory Coast, using a system of direct, centralized administration that left little room for Ivorian participation in policy-making.[46] The French colonial administration also adopted divide-and-rule policies, applying ideas of assimilation only to the educated elite.[46] The French were also interested in ensuring that the small but influential Ivorian elite was sufficiently satisfied with the status quo to refrain from developing anti-French sentiments and calls for independence.[46] Although strongly opposed to the practices of association, educated Ivorians believed that they would achieve equality in the French colonial system through assimilation rather than through complete independence from France.[46] After the assimilation doctrine was implemented through the postwar reforms, though, Ivorian leaders realized that even assimilation implied the superiority of the French over the Ivorians and that discrimination and inequality would end only with independence.[46]\n",

Angered that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, the union members united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphouët-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later, the French abolished forced labour. Houphouët-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that Ivory Coast would benefit from the relationship, which it did for many years. France appointed him as a minister, the first African to become a minister in a European government.[48]\n",

      "\n",
      "At independence (1960), the country was easily French West Africa's most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports. When Houphouët-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production, which was further boosted by a significant immigration of workers from surrounding countries. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting Ivory Coast into third place in world output, behind Brazil and Colombia. By 1979, the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa's leading exporter of pineapples and palm oil. French technicians contributed to the \"Ivorian miracle\". In other African nations, the people drove out the Europeans following independence, but in Ivory Coast, they poured in. The French community grew from only 30,000 prior to independence to 60,000 in 1980, most of them teachers, managers, and advisors.[50] For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10%—the highest of Africa's non-oil-exporting countries.\n",

Due to the overcutting of timber and collapsing sugar prices, the country's external debt increased three-fold.

As people originating from foreign countries are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivorian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained, which resulted in two civil wars in the following decades.\n",

Alassane Ouattara was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court, due to his alleged Burkinabé nationality.

The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning, but by lunchtime, the government forces had secured Abidjan. They had lost control of the north of the country, and rebel forces made their stronghold in the northern city of Bouaké.\n",

Whether French actions improved or worsened the situation in the long term is disputed. What exactly happened that night is also disputed. The government claimed that former president Robert Guéï led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims stated that he and 15 others had been murdered at his home, and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the German embassy; his home had been burned down. President Gbagbo cut short his trip to Italy and on his return stated, in a television address, that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers lived.

The unity government was unstable, and central problems remained, with neither side achieving its goals. In March 2004, 120 people were killed at an opposition rally, and subsequent mob violence led to the evacuation of foreign nationals. A later report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed to maintain a \"Zone of Confidence\", relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.\n",

During one of these airstrikes in Bouaké, on 6 November 2004, French soldiers were hit, and nine were killed; the Ivorian government said it was a mistake, but the French claimed it was deliberate.

The latter organization changed to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in 1975.

The country is the largest economy in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, constituting 40% of the monetary union's total GDP.

      "Close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agricultural exports, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labour force, inasmuch as instances of indentured labour have been reported in the country's cocoa and coffee production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor since 2009.[96]\n",
